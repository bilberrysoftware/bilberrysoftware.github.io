# Software

At Bilberry Software we believe in repeatable solutions. That's why over the years we've spotted gaps in the market and have created supported Open Source software to fill those gaps, saving time and money.

## Easy Workflow

Ever wanted to string together human decisions with your company's own software, or SaaS software? Don't want to hire an army of software engineers to achieve this?

We created Easy Workflow to take a simple workflow model of human decision steps and system steps (microservices and functions) and generate the 'glue' to link all these things together. Workflows can be either manually initiated through a web forms interface, or from any event that happens in your IT estate. Easy Workflow then launches the appropriate model and manages it through its lifecycle until completion.

With it's Turing Complete function set, ability to link to any microservice (RESTful HTTPs or Message/IoT based), and scalability to run over 60,000 actions every second on a single core on any Cloud, Easy Workflow can help you automate your processes in your organisation. It's lightweight nature even allows it to run at the Edge on embedded computer devices, in office comms cabinets, or on vehicles.

## Easy Workflow Streams

We found we were writing software to plug together re-usable microservices a lot. We also found some systems were generating millions of messages or events a day - a quantity way in excess of even the best trained human teams.

We built Easy Workflow Streams to handle millions of events a day and process them in an automated fashion. Using AI/ML techniques and simple configuration, we can extract the key events in a sea of activity, and highlight them to people for analysis and review. By linking with Easy Workflow, we can start new Investigations/Cases, filing these events in those case folders for later review and actioning. This enables your staff to respond to events in real time.

## Third party open source software

We have experience of deploying a wide range of open source software in mission critical environments. We've used PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, Kubernetes (many flavours), and many more leading open source solutions and designed, deployed and managed their installations for organisations.

## Why Commercial software powered by Open Source?

Many hands make light work. We built our software solutions on proven, reliable, and secure open source software that is deployed in thousands of companies worldwide. We also contribute patches and fixes to other open source projects so that the whole industry can benefit.

Equally though, organisations want to have a helping hand deploying, configuring, and maintaining these systems. This is where Bilberry Software can help. We can guide you through deploying these well proven solutions and can help you manage them, or even manage them for you.
