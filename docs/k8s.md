# Bilberry Kubernetes

We take a different approach to Kubernetes than other vendors. Rather than roll our own Kubernetes we instead wrap existing distributions with security hardening and best-practice rules, and a set of software packages to make your Kubernetes distribution immediately useful for hosting apps. We provide tooling around this to make
the process easy and streamlined.

## Bring your own Kubernetes

If you have an existing preferred Kubernetes distribution we can provide the Bilberry Kubernetes experience on top of it. Failing that, we can provide licenses and support for Kubernetes too. (Including secure FIPS mode build in).

## Security & best practice built in

When adopting a cluster, Bilberry Inventory will apply a standard networking and security lock down to your servers and to your Kubernetes distribution itself. Best practice is also applied for security and performance configurations within the cluster.

## Ready to use for apps

We provide common components - including load balancing, ingress, encrypted networking (including in-cluster), pod-to-pod authentication, and end-user authorisation without your developers having to write Authentication code - they just declare permissions required to access each service. 

We also provide common opensource application toolsets too, including S3 and Read-Write-Many storage for your apps, a relational database, reliable and secure streaming and messaging software which we support too. This means that - unlike other Kubernetes vendors - your cluster has the services ready for apps to run, without you needing to decide on a range of tooling yourself before you even think of writing an application.
