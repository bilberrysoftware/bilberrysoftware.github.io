# What do you want to do today?

## Architect a system

If you need expert advice on designing a system, or need a system suitability or upgrade review carrying out, or a full Business Outcomes Assessment, look no further than us. See our [Services page](services.md) for details.

## Create new software

[Contact us](contact-us.md) if you have a knotty problem that requires experienced staff, or that's so unique it may not have been done before. You may also want us to impart this knowledge, or knowledge of how to build agile software, into your own teams. We can pair with your own staff to give you ownership of anything we co-create.

## Run open source in mission critical environments

If you want a reliable solution built on top of open source software but with the peace of mind of a commercial support agreement, we can help. See our [Software page](software.md) for full details.

## Put compute in hard environments

From wearables to edge computing on vehicles all the way to data centre builds, we can advise on the best and most reliable way to get compute where you need it. [Contact us](contact-us.md) directly and we'll give you a free online consulting call to advise on how we could help you. We can advise on government or healthcare grade security needs too.
