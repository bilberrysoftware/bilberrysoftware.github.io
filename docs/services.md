# Services

Bilberry Software can provide a wide range of IT services to help your organisation with its key challenges. Below are our key activities, but please [Contact Us](contact-us.md) if you have additional needs.

## Agile Software Development

We have experience of creating balanced agile software development teams. We can provided these ourself, or pair with developers in your organisation to pass on our knowledge, enabling organic growth and skills sharing when we complete our project with you. These skills range beyond typical software development and extend to product design, and product management using Lean approaches.

We also have extensive experiences of setting up public and private cloud environments for reliable microservice based applications, with Enterprise grade security, as well as the development systems for those creating them. We have extensive experience of Cloud Native architectures and creating mechanisms for deploying applications to Kubernetes based services. If you need help architecting your application's platform, please contact us for advice which could save you a lot of time and money in the long term.

## Architectural Reviews

Our experts have been in the industry for many years. Take advantage of our expertise by asking us to review ongoing or historical projects, and advise on the most appropriate way forward. As independent consultants we do not have any bias towards any technology or vendor and so can act as a trusted third party.

## Crafting RFIs/RFPs

It can be challenging for organisations to know which direction to go with IT projects. Our experts can advise on this process and create materials to enable you to go to market and find the most applicable technology through helping you write architectural documentation, perform needs analyses, or write Requests for Information/Proposals for you.

## Solving complex problems, rapidly

For niche, unique, and extremely difficult problems you need advice from people with a wide range of experience who are used to working under pressure. Our consultants have worked in these environments before, and are adept at creating unique solutions to knotty problems, and doing so as fast as possible whilst achieving your mission objectives.

## Solution maturing services

Many small companies out there, especially those supplying defence and healthcare, have great ideas but are not sure how to finalise a product and have it ready for market. Our experienced engineers and technical sales consultants can help you take your early product or MVP and turn it into a fully realised product ready for your first paying customers. We can help you to rapidly get your product from TRL-3/4 to TRL 6. ([See UKRI's web page on Technical Readiness Levels](https://www.ukri.org/councils/stfc/guidance-for-applicants/check-if-youre-eligible-for-funding/eligibility-of-technology-readiness-levels-trl/)). We can help to produce sales pitches, demonstrations, and sales staff training materials to help you get customers quickly in the relevant industries you are targetting.

## Embedded solution design

From edge Internet of Things (IoT) devices to Bluetooth beacons, asset tags, or wearable smartwatches, our Engineers have created a range of custom hardware solutions using proven technologies to help organisations meet unique business challenges. If you need to deploy compute into unique places, or are developing a new electrical or computing product, contact our engineers to see if we can help design or advise on your project.

## Managed Services

We can provide managed services for public and private cloud software, including in secure government environments. We have experience in installing and managing key Cloud, VMware, and open source software services, and can advise on the best way to proceed, saving you time and money over complex and costly commercial alternatives.
