# About Us

Bilberry Software was set up to bring each of our consultants 20+ years experience directly to our customers rather than through large systems integrators or software companies.

Hiring very experienced consultants can normally be extremely expensive once large consulting companies overheads are baked in. By calling off our experienced consultants for just
the days you need us, you can get the best advice for the lowest possible price. You will also create a personal rapport with the consultants you work with, giving you someone
to help advise you for just when you need it, over the long term.

We don't believe in 'The hard sell' or in pushing our own services or software on those we advise. By working with you, rather than trying to sell ourselves to you, you will
learn to trust us so we get to know you well, and provide the best advice - even when that advice is to stop a project or hire different experts for the particular problem
you are facing.

We believe this mature and professional approach is best for helping our customers in the long term. We believe that once you work with us once, you'll want to continue working with us in the future.

Please [Contact Us](contact-us.md) for a free one-hour remote call and let us see if we can help and work with you.

Bilberry Software is registered in England and Wales, UK, as a private limited company. Company number: TODO

## Creed and Ethos

Our consultants have extensive experience in the open source movement, and with working with governments, healthcare organisations, and non-profits. Some of us worked at Pivotal Software, and we still live by that mantra:-

- Do what's right
- Do what works
- Always be kind

## Supporting our diverse community

Bilberry Software works with a wide range of individual consultants with a range of backgrounds. Some of our employees are neurodiverse, have disabilities, and/or are military reservists.  We believe by having a diverse set of people we can spot the best solutions and bring them to reality for our customers. We also give talks and presentations on the benefits of this diversity under pressure.

If you'd like to hear from us on this subject, or if you'd like to be considered for a Senior Consultant position, please [Contact Us](contact-us.md) and send a brief explanation of your experience. We'll then work with you to see if there's a way we can incorporate your expertise into our company.
